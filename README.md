# Modeling and analysis code for the E. coli extracellular electron transfer project

ElectricColiModelingClean.m contains scripts for flux balance analysis of the strains and conditions used in this project. These scripts require MATLAB, the COBRA toolbox (https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/stable/index.html), and a convex solver such as Gurobi (https://www.gurobi.com/) to run.
